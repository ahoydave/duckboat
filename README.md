For watching ducks attempting to make more ducks

`pi` contains the stuff you might want to run on a raspberry pi or two with attached IR camera and temperature probes (to compare temp inside and outside nest).

`watch-duck` contains web app for showing a graph of temperature and nest occupancy readings.

This is all embedded in https://duckbo.at (if it is still up...)
